### Hi there 👋

<!--
**MaxR522/MaxR522** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Sayna as a web developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning computer science on [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on web development project
- 💬 Ask me about anything you like (Maybe I have the answer :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
- ✍️ &nbsp;In my free time, I like working on my personal project (not always about code)
